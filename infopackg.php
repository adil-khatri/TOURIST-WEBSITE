Andaman, Ladakh, Himachal, Kerala, Goa, North East, South India, Bhutan and Rajasthan are among the top holiday destinations choices in the country. You can book a tour package to any of these destinations depending on your budget and other factors such as how long you would like to stay, your preference of activities such as historical tour, garden and lake visits, or you prefer water activities like snorkelling or scuba diving. There is a holiday to suit every budget as well as every preference of activity. From staying in a sprawling tea bungalow in Darjeeling to a cosy homestay at an apple orchard in Himachal Pradesh, you will really be spoilt for choice. Beach bums can hit Havelock in Andaman or go to Goa and spend a quiet holiday in the southern part of the state, soaking up some, tucking into sumptuous seafood and exploring the beaches and local markets.
